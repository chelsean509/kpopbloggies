	<p><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b></p>
	<p>Here at Pegate™, we strive to spread awareness of the benefits of an undermined form of romantic expression — pegging. In a society destroyed by toxic<br><br>masculinity, pegging is greatly shunned amongst the male community. We aim to hopefully change this in the near future — ideally in the very, very, very near future. <br><br> The goal is to get men to become more open to taking an object up their behinds. In a perfect world like this, everyone would be happy, Richard.<br><br><br><br>
