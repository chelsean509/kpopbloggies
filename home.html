	<p><b>WHAT IS PEGGING?</b></p>

Pegging<br><br> is a sexual practice in which a woman performs anal sex on a man by penetrating his anus with a strap-on dildo. This practice may also involve stimulating the male<br><br> genitalia.

The neologism "pegging" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in Dan Savage's "Savage Love" sex advice column, held after an<br><br> observation was made that there was no common name or dictionary definition for the act in the English language.<br><br><br><br>
<b>PLEASURABLE ASPECTS</b><br><br>
In terms of physical pleasure, a woman's genitals may get direct stimulation from the <br><br>base of the dildo, or in the case of a double-ended dildo, from vaginal (internal) <br><br>penetration. A woman can use a secondary vibrator, between the dildo and her genitals,<br><br> to get pleasure from pegging. Men may findstimulation of the anus, rectum, and <br><br>especially the prostate, pleasurable. During anal sex, male pleasure can be particularly <br><br>derived from the prostate, which can lead to an orgasm and ejaculation. Some men enjoy <br><br>masturbating (or being manually stimulated) during pegging. Triple-ended dildos provide <br><br>both vaginal and anal stimulation of the female partner.

Advice columnist Dan Savage wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may<br><br> introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.

<b>INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS</b><br><br>
A few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including Bend Over Boyfriend (1998), based on a series of lectures and workshops by Robert<br><br> Lawrence and Carol Queen and co-produced by Fatale Media, Inc. The movie was created and directed by Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, SIR Video Movies co-<br><br>founders. Bend Over Boyfriend originally inspired Dan Savage to call the act "BOBing" but his readers subsequently voted on the winning term, "pegging".

American <br><br>pornographic film director and sex educator Tristan Taormino released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 through Vivid Entertainment Studio, Tristan <br><br>Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men, featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it she teaches a workshop<br><br> with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual<br><br> devices and positions for pegging.

As an author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, Violet Blue wrote and released The<br><br> Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex in 2007.
